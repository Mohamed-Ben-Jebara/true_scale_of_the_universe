                    The universe is vast, almost too big to imagine. It’s a
                    place of infinite wonders and mysteries. Let’s take a
                    journey to understand its scale.
                    <br><br>
                    We start at Earth—our home. It’s huge to us, with a diameter
                    of over 12,700 kilometers. But in the solar system, Earth is
                    tiny. Did you know that over a million Earths could fit
                    inside the Sun?

                    <br><br>
                    Our solar system is massive, stretching billions of
                    kilometers across. If Earth were the size of a marble, the
                    Sun would be a big ball 14 meters away, and Neptune would
                    orbit as far as a football field. And here’s a fun fact: It
                    takes sunlight about eight minutes to reach us from the Sun,
                    even though it travels at the speed of light.

                    But the solar system is just one small part of the Milky
                    Way—a collection of hundreds of billions of stars. Our
                    galaxy is 100,000 light-years wide. To put that in
                    perspective, if you could travel at the speed of light, it
                    would still take you 100,000 years to cross it. That’s
                    longer than humans have existed.

                    <br><br>
                    Our galaxy belongs to a small neighborhood of galaxies
                    called the Local Group, which contains about 50 galaxies.
                    The nearest big galaxy, Andromeda, is 2.5 million
                    light-years away. And get this—Andromeda is on a collision
                    course with the Milky Way. In about 4.5 billion years,
                    they’ll merge to form a new galaxy. Astronomers have even
                    nicknamed it ‘Milkomeda.’

                    <br><br>
                    Galaxies form clusters, and these clusters group into
                    superclusters. The Laniakea Supercluster, our cosmic home,
                    is so vast it would take light 500 million years to travel
                    across it. Within Laniakea, there are over 100,000 galaxies,
                    each filled with billions of stars.

                    <br><br>
                    And beyond that? The observable universe. It’s 93 billion
                    light-years wide, containing an estimated two trillion
                    galaxies. That’s so many that if you tried to count them at
                    one per second, it would take you over 60,000 years. Each
                    galaxy has millions, billions, or even trillions of
                    stars—and who knows how many planets?

                    <br><br>
                    Here’s a mind-blowing thought: everything we can see, all
                    the galaxies, stars, and planets, make up just 5% of the
                    universe. The rest is dark matter and dark energy—mysterious
                    forces we don’t fully understand yet.

                    From the smallest particles to the largest galaxies, the
                    universe is a place of wonders. Did you know that the atoms
                    in your body were forged in stars? In a way, we are made of
                    stardust, connected to the cosmos itself. Isn’t that
                    amazing?
                    <img src="atom.jpeg">
                    <br><br>
                    The universe is vast. And as long as we keep wondering,
                    exploring, and asking questions, there will always be more
                    to discover.
